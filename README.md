# osu!AL-1S

A simple osu! bot framework written in Java, trying to wrap [osu!api v2](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) to simpler form like [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/).

The name is originated from a girl [Aris](https://bluearchive.wiki/wiki/Arisu) from [BlueArchive](https://bluearchive.jp).

osu!AL-1S is still under early construction and not ready for formal usage.
